## My Mission
I am a data scientist working in computational cancer biology. I am especially interested in digging through complex datasets to find insights  that can ultimately lead to better therapies for patients. This definitely isnâ€™t a solo mission. Modern biology is incredibly complex, so I work closely with molecular biologists, immunologists, and clinicians. Together, we design experiments, analyse the data and try to understand the underlying principles of cancer progression and translate them into clinics.

I am part of [Momo Bentires-Alj](https://bentireslab.org/article-page/) research lab,   and also a member of Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics in the group of [Robert Ivanek](https://www.sib.swiss/directory/group/dbm-bioinformatics-core-facility).

I am one of the founders of [RXcel](https://rxcel.ch), a start-up where we aim at designing "smart" therapeutic RNAs to target aggressive solid tumors.

Next to the world of math, biology and data, there is another one that completely immerses me from time to time, and that's music. You can listen to some of my  production on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/michael-kloc).

## My Interests

There are roughly four main areas I am currently particularly interested in
*   What can we learn about [cell-cell interactions in single-cell](https://github.com/MikeKlocCZ/2025_scRNA_brain_mets_MassagueJ)  data how can we overlay multiple modalities, mainly with spatially-resolved data.

*  How can we infer reliably kinase activities from phosphoproteomic data to help identify novel therapeutical targets.

* How dynamical pattens in intracellular signaling determine cell fate or how precisely  we can model transcriptional regulation from sparse time-resolved sequencing or qPCR data.

* How "smart" RNA design allows to control optimal delivery profile of the effector protein.

For more details, see the Project section.



<!-- *  Kinases are important players in intracellular signaling and can often be dysregulated (not only) in cancer. Inferring their activity from phosphoproteomic data is challenging, but a recently published [resource](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/JohnsonKinaseData.html) for motif-based kinase scoring has significantly improved our ability to tackle this problem. Tested on data with known ground truth, dysregulated kinases were correctly identified, though false positives were common. To improve specificity, additional signaling patterns  and features "behind the linear motifs" should be integrated. 

* Recent advances in the field of optimal control have incorporated machine learning techniques into its standard toolkit. One concrete example is represented by neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs). This approach merges a mechanistic modelling of known dynamics in the form of ODEs with neural networks (NNs) embedded in it. Such models can be used to identify optimal control sequences that drive a system along a desired trajectory or to infer missing components of a mechanistic model from data. The approach can be extended to other types of differential equations (for example stochastic dynamics).  We are looking into these tools, for example, to help us understand dynamical interplay between transcription factors, or to decode complex patterns in cellular signaling.

## My Journey
I studied Physics at Charles University in Prague. My field of study was Nuclear and Subnuclear Physics. For my PhD I joint the group of [Prof. Pavel Cejnar](https://ipnp.cz/cejnar/publikace/clanky.html) where I specialized in Computational Quantum Physics of Many-Body Systems. After my PhD I was a visiting scientist at Technical University in Berlin and then I moved to Basel in 2019. I started as a post-doc in the group of [Prof. Christoph Bruder](https://quantumtheory-bruder.physik.unibas.ch/en/) where we worked on optimal control using tools of scientific machine learning. In 2021, I made a career shift towards biology and joined the lab of [Prof. Momo Bentires-Alj](https://bentireslab.org/article-page/). In 2023, I co-founded RXcel.
