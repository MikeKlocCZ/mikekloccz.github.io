## Understanding The World Through Data and Mathematics
There is an old saying , attributed to Galileo, that the laws of Nature are written in the language of mathematics. After 10+ years in quantitative research, I can only confirm: he was right. I am trained as a theoretical and computational physicist but over my career I have had the opportunity to apply mathematics across multiple fields of research, including quantum computing, engineering, biology, and medicine. Currently, I work in computational cancer biology, where I take on multiple roles. First, I provide statistical consulting and data analysis for pre-clinical and clinical research projects, and together with wet-lab researchers, I help interpret the data. Second, I develop novel machine learningâ€“based approaches to uncover dynamical patterns in biological data, with the potential to predict cell fate under drug perturbations. And third, I am interested in biotech business development, as I want to better understand how research can be translated into real-world impact.

I am
* A member  of [Momo Bentires-Alj](https://bentireslab.org/article-page/) research lab,   and also a member of *Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics* in the group of [Robert Ivanek](https://www.sib.swiss/directory/group/dbm-bioinformatics-core-facility).

*  One of the *founders of [RXcel](https://rxcel.ch)*, a pre-seed start-up where we aim at designing "smart" therapeutic RNAs to target aggressive solid tumors.

Next to the world of math, biology and data, there is another one that completely immerses me from time to time, and that's music. You can listen to some of my  production on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/michael-kloc).

## My Interests

There are roughly four main areas I am currently particularly interested in:

*   What can we learn about [cell-cell interactions in single-cell](https://github.com/MikeKlocCZ/2025_scRNA_brain_mets_MassagueJ)  data how can we overlay multiple modalities, mainly with spatially-resolved data.

* How dynamical pattens in intracellular signalling determine cell fate or how precisely  we can model transcriptional regulation from sparse time-resolved sequencing or qPCR data.

* How "smart" RNA design allows to control optimal delivery profile of the effector protein.





<!-- *  Kinases are important players in intracellular signaling and can often be dysregulated (not only) in cancer. Inferring their activity from phosphoproteomic data is challenging, but a recently published [resource](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/JohnsonKinaseData.html) for motif-based kinase scoring has significantly improved our ability to tackle this problem. Tested on data with known ground truth, dysregulated kinases were correctly identified, though false positives were common. To improve specificity, additional signaling patterns  and features "behind the linear motifs" should be integrated. 

* Recent advances in the field of optimal control have incorporated machine learning techniques into its standard toolkit. One concrete example is represented by neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs). This approach merges a mechanistic modelling of known dynamics in the form of ODEs with neural networks (NNs) embedded in it. Such models can be used to identify optimal control sequences that drive a system along a desired trajectory or to infer missing components of a mechanistic model from data. The approach can be extended to other types of differential equations (for example stochastic dynamics).  We are looking into these tools, for example, to help us understand dynamical interplay between transcription factors, or to decode complex patterns in cellular signaling.

*  How can we infer reliably kinase activities from phosphoproteomic data?

## My Journey
I studied Physics at Charles University in Prague. My field of study was Nuclear and Subnuclear Physics. For my PhD I joined the group of [Prof. Pavel Cejnar](https://ipnp.cz/cejnar/publikace/clanky.html) where I specialized in Computational Quantum Physics of Many-Body Systems. After my PhD I was a visiting scientist at Technical University in Berlin and then I moved to Basel in 2019. I started as a post-doc in the group of [Prof. Christoph Bruder](https://quantumtheory-bruder.physik.unibas.ch/en/) where we worked on optimal control with machine learning. In 2021, I made a career shift towards biomedicine  and joined the lab of [Prof. Momo Bentires-Alj](https://bentireslab.org/article-page/). In 2023, I co-founded [RXcel](https://rxcel.ch).



## What Can Be Found Here
Reason for these web pages is to communicate results, thoughts and my experience that not always end in papers. I can imagine it will be constantly under construction, but already now you can check the [Projects](https://mikekloccz.github.io/projects/) section where I give quick description about some recently finished or running projects. Some of the talks I have given are in section [Talks](https://mikekloccz.github.io/talks/). Some are purely technical notes on my experience with various bioinformatics tools. I believe they could be valuable to share with the community, but they are the kind of insights that would never be published on their own.  If time allows, I will add more "blog posts" about these topics in the future, and not just the pdf slides.
