Contribution at the  [Computational Systems Biology of Cancer](https://training.institut-curie.org/courses/sysbiocancer2023) meeting at Institut Curie which won the "best talk" prize. 

In the talk, I mostly focused on how we extract molecular fingerprints from the derived tumors using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Subsequently, we project triple-negative breast cancer patients' samples from TCGA and Metabric on the latent space and divide them by the exposure to the Procr-metagene. We show that patients with high exposure show generally decreased survival.
