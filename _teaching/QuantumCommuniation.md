An undergraduate course for students  at Department of Physics of the University of Basel.  

The course covers introduction to quantum information (quantum bits, superposition, Deutsch algorithm), then introduces the problem of decoherence (i.e., loss of quantum properties) and classical and quantum error correction problems. In the end, topics of quantum cryptography are discussed together with "quantum hardware" (i.e. physical implementations of qubits).
