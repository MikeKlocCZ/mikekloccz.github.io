## A model is worth a thousand data sets


There are two fundamental ways how we can try to understand  dynamical phenomena in Nature. The traditional one is based on mathematical modelling. We look at the system of interest, strip away "all unnecessary features" whose contribution to the dynamics are "of lower orders" and build a mechanistic model under these simplifying conditions. Such models can be very powerful for qualitative understanding of mutual interactions between the actors of the system, but due to the simplifications, quantitative predictions might be incorrect. An example from physics could be the [Ising model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model) of magnetization. In its simplest 2D form, the microscopic magnetic moments (spins) are placed on a lattice and only short-range (nearest-neighbor) interactions are considered. Thus, the minimal-energy state is associated with all spins aligned, i.e., a ferromagnetic state. By introducing temperature, we
